#3. Body Mass Index (page 185)
#Write a program that calculates and displays a person’s body mass index (BMI).
#The BMI is often used to determine whether a person with a sedentary lifestyle
#is overweight or underweight for his or her height. A person’s BMI is calculated with the following formula:
#BMI = Weight x 703 / Height ^ 2
#where weight is measured in pounds and height is measured in inches.
#The program should display a message indicating whether the person has optimal weight,
#is underweight, or is overweight. A sedentary person’s weight is considered optimal if 
#his or her BMI is between 18.5 and 25. If the BMI is less than 18.5, the person is 
#considered underweight. If the BMI value is greater than 25, the person is considered overweight.



height = 0
weight = 0

height = float(input("Please enter your height: \n"))
if height > 0:
      weight = float(input("Please enter your weight: \n"))
      BMI=float((weight * 703) / (height**2))

      if weight > 0:
            print("BMI = ", "{:.2f}".format(BMI),sep='')
            if BMI < 18:
                  print("You are underweight.",sep='')
            elif BMI > 25:
                  print("You are overweight.",sep='')
            else: 
                  print("You are optimal.",sep='')
      else:
            print("That's an invalid weight.")
else:
      print("That's an invalid height.")
